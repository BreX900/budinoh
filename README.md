client.buildApk(env: , args: );

client.buildAppBundle(env: , args: );

client.buildIpa(exportOptions: , env: , args: );
```

### Distribution client

```dart
final client = DistributionClient();

/// Use the Firebase CLI
client.uploadToFirebaseByCli(buildFile, appId: , releaseNotes: ,groups: );
/// Use the Firebase Rest Api
client.uploadToFirebaseByApi(buildFile, credentials: , appId: , releaseNotes: ,groups: );

/// Use the 'xcrun altool --upload-app' command
client.uploadAppToAppleStore(buildFile, apiIssuer: , apiKeyId: , apiKey: );

client.uploadToGoogleStore(buildFile, credentials: , packageName: );
```

## Collect your credentials

### Firebase

1. Open the [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) Console and select your project.
2. Click Create Service Account and enter service account details.
3. Click Create and Continue.
4. Add the Firebase App Distribution Admin role and click Done.
5. Create a private JSON key and move the key to a location accessible to your build environment. Be sure to keep this file somewhere safe, because it grants administrator access to App Distribution in your Firebase project.
